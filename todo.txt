Fix "jump to exit prone" not working as intended
Add "sprint to exit prone" (can be easily done after "jump to exit prone" is fixed)
Allow "prone delay" convar to utilize the entire number
Dynamic Height 2 compatability(?) Alternatively, make qProne 100% standalone (ie find a way to make the camera not weird)
Omnimovement compatability(?)
Make standalone from wOS (apparently it was not as easy as I thought... and I can't seem to figure out how the original prone mod does it, since it the code is the exact fucking same.)
