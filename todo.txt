Fix "jump to exit prone" not working as intended
Add "sprint to exit prone" (easily done after previous problem is fixed)
Allow "prone delay" convar to utilize the entire number (currently it ignores anything past the decimal)
Dynamic Height 2 compatability(?) Alternatively, make qProne 100% standalone
Omnimovement compatability(?)
